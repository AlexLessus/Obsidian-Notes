## Data quality
A common phrase in machine learning is garbage in garbage out. 

This basically means that the quality of the output depends on the quality of the input. With bad data, applications that use machine learning will produce results that are inaccurate, incomplete or incoherent. Let's look at some examples.![[Pasted image 20260213225626.png]]

## Beware
It should be clear by now that you shouldn't blindly trust your model.

Be critical of its output. 

Awareness of the role of data is key. When working on a machine learning project it is extremely important to pay attention to the data that is used. So although machine learning can be very powerful, keep in mind, ==a machine learning model is only as good as the data you give it.==


## Quality assurance
Having high quality data requires: 
- **Data analysis** including data characteristics, distribution, source, and relevance. 
- **A review of outliers**, exceptions, and anything that stands out as suspicious. 
- **Domain expertise** from experts to explain unexpected data patterns. 
- **Documentation**. The process used must be transparent and repeatable.

# Explainability
One of the biggest challenges in AI is that often machine learning models are considered black boxes.

However, sometimes there is a need for AI systems to be transparent about the reasoning it uses, to increase trust, clarity, and understanding. 

For example, you will have to be able to explain your model to get business adoption from a customer, to prove you are adhering to laws regarding data, and allow for faster and better bias detection.![[Pasted image 20260213230123.png]]
