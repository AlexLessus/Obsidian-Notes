Basically a Labeling machine

# Classification
Classification consists in assigning a category to an observation. 
We're predicting a discrete variable, a variable that can only take a few different values. 
- Is this customer going to stop its subscription or not? 
- Is this mole cancerous or not? Is this wine red, white or rosé? 
- Is this flower a rose, a tulip, a carnation, a lily?

## Técnicas
- Arboles de decision
- Clasificador de bayes
- Maquina de soporte vectorial SVM
- K-vecino mas cercano KNM
- Redes neuronales
- Random forest

# Regression
Assigning a continuous variable
- how much will this stock be worth? 
- What is this exoplanet's mass? 
- How tall will this child be as an adult?

## Técnicas
- Regresión lineal
- Regresión logística

## Classification vs regression
It's up to you to choose whether you want to frame your problem as a regression or classification problem. 
For example, we could predict an exact temperature, or a categorical range of temperatures like "Cold", "Mild", and "Hot". This is true for something like age, where we can have categories like baby, child, teenager, adult, and so on! Do you see the difference?
