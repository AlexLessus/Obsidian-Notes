# Directory Overview

This directory is an Obsidian vault, structured as a "second brain" for a software engineer. It's designed for long-term knowledge management, daily note-taking, and project tracking, following a system similar to the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive).

The vault is organized using a numerical prefix system to maintain a consistent folder order.

# Usage

This vault is intended to be used with the Obsidian application. The user can create, link, and manage notes to build a comprehensive personal knowledge base. The folder structure provides a framework for organizing information, but the power of Obsidian lies in the connections made between individual notes via internal links.
